COVID-19 Dataset Analysis Dashboard
The goal of this project was to provide a comprehensive visual analysis of global COVID-19 cases, deaths, and new cases across continents and countries.
The dashboard aimed to offer insights into how different regions were affected over time.

Data Source(s):
The data was sourced from several databases, including publicly available COVID-19 datasets. After collecting the data, I edited and cleaned it using Power BI's Query Editor to ensure consistency and accuracy before visualizing it.

Tools & Technologies:
Power BI's Query Editor for data cleaning and editing.
Mathematical methods applied to analyze and manipulate data effectively.
Power BI for creating interactive visualizations and dashboards.
